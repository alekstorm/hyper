Hyper: HTTP/2.0 for Python
=================================

Release v\ |version|.

HTTP is changing under our feet. HTTP/1.1, our old friend, is being
supplemented by the brand new HTTP/2.0 standard. HTTP/2.0 provides many
benefits: improved speed, lower bandwidth usage, better connection management,
and more.

``hyper`` provides these benefits to your Python code. How? Like this::

    from hyper import HTTP20Connection

    conn = HTTP20Connection('twitter.com:443')
    conn.request('GET', '/')
    resp = conn.getresponse()

    print(resp.read())

Simple. ``hyper`` is written in 100% pure Python, which means no C extensions.
It is also 100% self-contained: there are no external dependencies beyond the
Python standard library.

``hyper`` supports Python 2.7 and 3.3+ on CPython and PyPy.

Caveat Emptor!
--------------

Please be warned: ``hyper`` is in a very early alpha. You *will* encounter bugs
when using it. In addition, there are very many rough edges. With that said,
please try it out in your applications: I need your feedback to fix the bugs
and file down the rough edges.
